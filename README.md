## Overview

This project focuses on detecting diseases in plants using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** trained on leaf images. It helps farmers and agricultural experts identify diseases early, ensuring timely intervention and improved crop health.

> Built with deep learning + image classification  
> Accessible via a simple **Streamlit web app**  
> Achieved **over 95% accuracy** on validation set
